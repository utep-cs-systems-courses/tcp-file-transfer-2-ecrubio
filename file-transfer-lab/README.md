Forked Server and Client

To run the program, fServer.py need to be executed which will keep listening
for a connection until something is sent or there was an error. fClient.py
checks if the file is valid and then send it to server that is connected.

f-transferServer.py and f-transferClient.py are previous versions of
fServer.py and fClient.py, it was just easier to type fServer than
f-transferServer so I renamed them.To avoid losing the previous version of the
lab I decided to keep them there.
